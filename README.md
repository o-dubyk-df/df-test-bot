# Test telegram bot

## Local Development

### [localstack](https://docs.localstack.cloud/getting-started/installation/)

### Deployment to localstack

define variables in .env

```
make start
```

grab stack output to get api endpoint

### Testing

```
curl  -i -k -XPOST https://fc9c1488.execute-api.us-east-1.localhost.localstack.cloud/ -d '{"update_id":813352806,"message":{"message_id":186,"from":{"id":879487978,"is_bot":false,"first_name":"Test","last_name":"Test","language_code":"uk"},"chat":{"id":879487978,"first_name":"Test","last_name":"Test","type":"private"},"date":1708367401,"text":"hello"}}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```


### Tasks for test

1. Modify the code so that the bot only responds to the “/hello” command or any message containing “hello” in any case.
2. Ensure that the SQS queue does not receive the full Telegram payload but instead only the minimal data required to generate a message to the client in the Lambda function sqs.py.
3. Additionally, create unit tests for both AWS Lambda functions: api.py and sqs.py.
